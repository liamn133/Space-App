                <h3>Huge distances, speeds and quantities</h3>
                Hundreds of billions of stars with potentially trillions of planets. The milky way galaxy spans 100,000
                light years across. The Milky Way is known as a spiral galaxy, with the solar system located on the Orion Arm. Our solar system travels at
                an incredible speed of nearly 1 million km/h around the centre of the milky way, these tremendous speeds caused by the gravitational pull of the 
                black hole in the centre of the galaxy

                The milky way galaxy is expected to collide with the nearby Andromeda galaxy in 4 billion years
