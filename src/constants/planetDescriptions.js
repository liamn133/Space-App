        `First telescopically observed by Gallileo in the 17th Century, Mercury is the closest planet to the sun at a distance of 57.9 million kilometres. 
        Due to the fact it has almost no atmosphere, mercury endures extreme temperatures which fluctuate from −173 °C to 423 °C.
        The surface composition of Mercury is very similar to that of the moon, with various craters traversing the planet.`

        `Venus is the second closest planet to the Sun, at approximately 108 million kilometres. It has a harsh atmosphere containing a large amount of carbon dioxide, which contributes
         to the highest temperatures out of any planet in the solar system, topping out at a scorching 465°C. In addition to blistering temperatures,
         Venus also has atmospheric pressure over 90 times larger than Earth.

        description : `The only cellestial body in the solar system with known lifeforms, Earth is in the Sun's "goldilocks zone", with its orbit a perfect 
        distance away to sustain life. The majority of Earth is covered by water, and it has an atmosphere dominated by nitrogen and oxygen. The Earth has one
        natural satellite, our moon.

        description : `Also known as the red planet and named after the Roman god of war, Mars has very similar features to that of Earth. The days are approximately the same
        length as Earth days, with comparable seasons as well. There is the possibility of lifeforms inhabiting Mars in the past or even currently, with underground ice
        discovered by NASA missions. Mars remains the next destination in our exploration of the solar system.

        name : "Jupiter",
        description : `The first of the gas giants, Jupiter is the largest planet in the solar system. Jupiter's atmosphere is composed mainly of hyrdogen, helium and ammonium compounds. The planet has a vast number of moons, with various
        landscapes. A distinguishing feature of the Jupiter is the Great Red Spot, a powerful storm brewing on the planet first observed by astronomers as early
        as 1665. This storm has a diameter 1.3 times the size of Earth!

        description : `The first of the ice giant planets, a somewhat unknown fact is that Uranus also has a ring system just like Saturn. Although it
        can be seen with the naked eye, it was confused for another other space object like a star or a comet before it's discovery as a planet by William Herschel in 1781.
        Uranus is the coldest planet in the solar system reaching temperatures of -224°C

         The planet has tremendous wind speeds exceeding 2000 km/h. Neptune's largest moon Triton was measured as having the coldest temperature out of any mass in the solar system
         at a freezing -235°C.
